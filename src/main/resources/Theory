The @OneToMany, @ManyToOne or @ManyToOne is responsible to create an extra relationship table.
If we want to avoid creation of separate rel table we can use annotation followed by the attribute (mappedBy = "variable name used in other mapping class")

---------------------------------------------

Laptop Class-
@ManyToOne
    private Student student;


 Student Class-

@OneToMany(mappedBy = "student")  // mappedBy attribute will stop the annotaion to create and extra table student_laptop to maintain the relationship.
    private List<Laptop>  laptop = new ArrayList<>();

ManyToMany annotation maintains two extra table so to avoid that follow same mappedBy attribute with the Annotation.
student_laptop table and laptop_student table.

One table if enough to know about rel so we can avoid creating extra table.

@ManyToMany(mappedBy = "student")
    private List<Laptop> laptop = new ArrayList<>();
